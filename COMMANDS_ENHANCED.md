## Tips for Best Results

### Voice Recognition Tips

1. **Speak Clearly:** Use normal speaking volume and pace
2. **Use "Gideon":** Include "Gideon" in commands for better recognition
3. **Reduce Noise:** Minimize background noise
4. **Wait for Response:** Let Gideon respond before giving next command
5. **Check Microphone:** Ensure microphone is working properly

### Command Tips

1. **Natural Language:** Gideon understands variations
   - ✓ "open chrome" = "chrome kholo" = "start chrome"
   - ✓ "what time is it" = "time batao" = "tell me the time"

2. **Workflows:** Use workflows for repetitive multi-step tasks
   - Instead of: "open chrome", "open vs code", "open notepad"
   - Say: "start my workday"

3. **Scheduling:** Schedule recurring tasks
   - "at 9 AM start my workday"
   - "at 2 PM take a break"

4. **Confirmation:** Critical actions require confirmation
   - Gideon will ask "Are you sure?" for destructive operations
   - Say "yes" to confirm, "no" to cancel

### Exit Commands

**Most Reliable Exit Commands:**
- "quit gideon"
- "exit gideon"
- "gideon quit"

**Note:** Simple "quit" or "exit" also work, but using "gideon" is more reliable.
